## Research Experiences
### **SSVAT: Squence-to-set Variational Autoencoding Transformer for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis** `09/2023–Now`
*Supervisor: Professor Chris Williams*  
Tested a sequence-to-set generative model in 3D indoor scene synthesis.

### **Modelling Object Co-Occurences in Images** `02/2023–09/2023`
*Supervisor: Professor Chris Williams*  
Modelled high-dimensional object count data from COCO dataset using VAE, mixture, discrete flow and diffusion models. Developed a sequence-to-set variational autoencoding transformer modeling the sparse counts as sets. Compared the models using the likelihood and the sample quality (introducing a discriminator network).

### **Human Probability Judgments: A Bayesian Sequential Sampler Account** `02/2021–09/2021`
*Supervisors: Professor Adam Sanborn & Professor Nick Chater*  
Developed a diffusion-based model to explain human probability judgments. Collected data from online experiments. Fitted the model using moment matching and compared its variants with different stopping rules using the Wasserstein distance.

### **A Model Comparison Study for Human Choices in Two-Armed Bandit Problems: Reinforcement Learning and Win-Stay-Loss-Shift Heuristics** `09/2019–07/2020`  
*Supervisor: Associate Professor Junyi Dai*  
Modelled human choices in two-armed bandit problems using the temporal difference reinforcement learning and the win-stay-loss-shift heuristics. Fitted the models using maximum likelihood and compared their variants with different learning rules on one-step-ahead and long term predictive abilities.

## Projects
### **Deep Bayesian Active Learning with Hybrid Query Strategies** `2023`
### **Machine Translation Systems with Transformers Using Lexical Models** `2023`
### **A Review of Dirichlet Process Mixture Models for Clustering and Density Estimation** `2023`
### **A Review of Sequential Sampling Models in Computational Cognitive Neuroscience** `2021`
### **A Comparison of Different Generalized Cognitive Hierarchy Models for Matrix Games** `2020`


## Work Experience
### **Shokz** `05/2022–09/2022`
```
Shenzhen, China
```
*Data Analyst*   
Developed and updated the dashboard of sales data. Predicted sales data during the promotion using time-series models.

### **Openverse** `09/2023–Now`
```
Hangzhou, China
```
*Multimodal Research Engineer* 
Clustered blackhole images based on painting styles using the BLIP model with prompting tricks. Finetuned the diffusion model to generate blackhole images in different styles. Injected domain knowledge to the generative models to generate correct scientific images.
