## Research Experiences
### **Modelling Object Co-Occurences in Images with Deep Generative Models**
*Supervisor: Professor Chris Williams*
Modelled high-dimensional object count data from COCO dataset using VAE, discrete flow and diffusion models. Developed a sequence-to-set transformer varitational autoencoder regarding the sparse counts as sets of object embeddings and transforming sequence probabilities to set probabilities.

### **Human Probability Judgments: A Bayesian Sequential Sampler Account** `06/2021–09/2021`
*Supervisors: Professor Adam Sanborn & Professor Nick Chater*  
Developed a diffusion-based model to explain human probability judgements. Collected data from online experiments and compared its variants with different stopping rules using the Wasserstein distance

### **A Model Comparison Study for Human Choices in Two-Armed Bandit Problems: Reinforcement Learning and Win-Stay-Loss-Shift Heuristics** `03/2020–07/2020`  
*Supervisor: Associate Professor Junyi Dai*  
Modelled human choices in two-armed bandit problems using temporal difference reinforcement learning and the win-stay-loss-shift heristics. Compared their variants with different learning rules on one-step-ahead and long term predictive abilities.

## Projects
### **Deep Bayesian Active Learning with Hybrid Query Strategies** `2023`
### **A Review of Sequential Sampling Models in Computational Cognitive Neuroscience** `2021`
### **A Comparison of Different Generalized Cognitive Hierarchy Models for Matrix Games** `2020`
### **The Effect of Background Information on Speed Perception in Three-Dimensional Space: A VR-Based Study** `2018`
